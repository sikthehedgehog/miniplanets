This is the source FontForge file for the Planelagos.ttf font you can get
from the itch.io page. You can regenerate it as-is if you want, but for best
results you may want to do the following first:

* Change em size to 1024 (let FontForge adjust everything)
* Select all, remove overlaps
* Select all, generate hints

Not much else to say!
